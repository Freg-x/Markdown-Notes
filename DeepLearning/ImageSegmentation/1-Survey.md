## Notes for Image Segmentation using deep learning

[toc]

### About

This note is based on Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning: A Survey[Shervin Minaee et al.]. 

### Introduction

**Traditional image segemtation algorithm**  includes thresholding, histogram-based bundling, region-growing, k-means clustering, watershed etc.

**More advanced algorithm** includes active contours, graph cuts, condition and Markov random fields and sparsity based methods

Recently, **deep learning networks** have yielded a new generation of image segemention models with **remarkable** performance improvements - often achieve highest accuracy rates on popular benchmarks - resulting in what many regard as a **paradigm shift** in the field.
